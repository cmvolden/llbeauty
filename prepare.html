    <h1>Preparing For Your Appointment</h1>

    <h2>Lash Appointments</h2>

    <p class="push-1-4 milli">Wearing a mask is required during the full length of your visit at LavyLash&Beauty.</p>
    <p class="push-1-4 milli">Please arrive alone and use the hand sanitizer provided prior to entering the treatment room.</p>
    <p class="push-1-4 milli">A COVID-19 form must be filled out before your appointment begins.</p>
    <p class="push-1-4 milli">Please arrive 10 minutes early to your appointment in the event that you may need to remove your eye makeup. Arriving with your eye makeup on will shorten the length of your lash application.</p>
    <p class="push-1-4 milli">No creams around the eye area, or oil on your lashes. This will affect retention.</p>
    <p class="push-1-4 milli">Avoid caffeine and energy drinks prior to your appointment. Your appointment will be most successful if you are calm and relaxed.</p>
    <p class="push-1-4 milli">Avoid using waterproof makeup on your eyes, especially waterproof mascara as it will affect retention.</p>
    <p class="push-1-4 milli">Wear comfortable clothing and be ready to fall asleep. Bring your own blanket if needed.</p>
    <p class="push-1-4 milli">Follow all after care instructions to maintain a healthy lash line.</p>
    <p class="push-1-4 milli">After care products are available for sale, let us know if you are interested and we will have them ready for pick up before you leave.</p>
    <p class="push-3-4 milli">Don’t forget to book your refill appointment before you leave, and share the love! We rely on your reviews and word of mouth.</p>

    <h2>Permanent Makeup</h2>

    <p>Book and attend your personal consultation. Afterward, you will be given specific instructions based on your chosen treatment. It is extremely important to follow the guidelines given to you prior to your appointment.</p>

    <h3>For All Treatments</h3>

    <p class="push-1-4 milli">Please wear sunscreen, avoid sun exposure and sun burns.</p>
    <p class="push-1-4 milli">No self-tanners or spray tan several weeks prior to your appointment.</p>
    <p class="push-1-4 milli">Retinol/Retin-A must be discontinued 7 days prior to procedure as it will cause the skin to bleed.</p>
    <p class="push-1-4 milli">Injections (Botox, Radiesse, JuvaDerm, Voluma, etc.) must be done at least 2 weeks before/after procedure.</p>
    <p class="push-1-4 milli">Chemical peels and laser treatments may not be done within 60 days before or after procedure.</p>
    <p class="push-1-4 milli">If you are smoker you will have better results if you stop smoking at least 6 weeks prior to your appointment. It is very important as it will affect the healing.</p>
    <p class="push-1-4 milli">No Alcohol, coumadin, aspirin, ibuprofen, niacin, fish oil or vitamin-E 3 days prior to procedure.</p>
    <p class="push-1-4 milli">Please consult with your physician before stopping any prescribed medication.</p>
    <p class="push-3-4 milli">No contact lenses on the day of your Brow or Eyeliner procedure.</p>

    <h3>Lip Procedures</h3>

    <p class="push-1-4 milli">If you suffer from cold sores fever blisters you must start a prophylactic antiviral treatment (cold sore medication) prior to your procedure. It is extremely important to do so. Although it may not 100% avoid a reaction, it will help reduce the chance of a reaction.</p>
    <p class="push-1-4 milli">I highly recommended asking for a second prescription, Xeresel, an antiviral/steroid ointment medication to be used topically after your lip treatment. The procedure will be postponed in the event you were not able to start the medication.</p>
